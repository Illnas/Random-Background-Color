Random Background Color Project   




So, I found this page when I was looking for ideas for BEGINNER's JS projects to build up my knowledge and skills of JS and DOM manipulations:

              "https://jsbeginners.com/javascript-projects-for-beginners/" .
           
           
And I have to admit, this is really good idea, to do 100 JS projects that would start from basics to expert things you should know. So, here it is,
my first serious JS project. 

See ya in next one ;)
